# Cap1xxx-Java
Cap1xxx library for Java, derived from python libraries to enable use on core java devices such as raspberry pi.

This library was written primarily for the Cap1166 chip found in Pimoronis Touch Phat which im currently using with the raspberry pi.

Very simple to use and is mostly identical which the functionality this version offers with Pimoronis own code, I've not converted everything over however.
